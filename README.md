# Talks gem â€” now your ruby and command-line tools can talk with you

### This is in beta now.

### Build Status ![http://travis-ci.org/ruby-talks/talks](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ruby-talks/talks.png)

If you want to HEAR some response from your code or command-line tools, just use this gem.

You can use this gem on MacOS X and on other linux/unix systems with [espeak](http://espeak.sourceforge.net) installed.

## Why?

### Example

You're running some really long task and you leave the desk to drink some coffee, read a book or surf the internet
and you want to be notified that the task has finished its execution. You don't want to check your machine each minute. With this gem
you can just add a little hook at the end of your code and when the execution ends - you will hear it in voice
that you have chosen from MacOS X `say` function collection or from `espeak` collection.

You can find some examples of `talks` usage in organization [ruby-talks](https://github.com/ruby-talks):

  * [rails-talks](https://github.com/ruby-talks/rails-talks)
  * [bundler-talks](https://github.com/ruby-talks/bundler-talks)
  * [spec-talks](https://github.com/ruby-talks/spec-talks)

## How?

On MacOS X this gem is just using the native MacOS X `say` command line tool.
On linix/unix this gem is using espeak speech synthesis.

### In all examples below I've used MacOS X voice types. For espeak you can read section [Using talks with espeak](https://github.com/ruby-talks/talks#using-talks-with-espeak)

### Configuration

You can configure default voices and messages for `talks` with `~/.talksrc` file or with `your_project/.talksrc` file. It should be written in YAML format:

`~/.talksrc`
```yml
default_voice: 'whisper'
engine: 'say'
voices:
  info: 'pipe'
messages:
  info: 'hello'
  warn: 'WE GONNA DIE!!!'
```

You can also do it in your code dynamically through Talks.config instance.

You can configure only the default voice for `say` method and voices and messages for 4 types of talks: `info, warn, success, error`

For command-line commands you can configure default voices and hook messages:

`~/.talksrc`
```yml
bundle:
  voice: 'vicki'
  before_message: 'Bundler again will do all right'
  after_message: "Bundler's job is done here"
```

You can create your own default preferences for each command-line tool which you want to run with `talks` or `talking` command in front:

`~/.talksrc`
```yml
ls:
  voice: 'bad'
  before_message: 'Now we will see what in the directory'
  after_message: ''
cap:
  ...
vim:
  ...
scp:
  ...
... and etc
```

### Using talks/talking command-line tool

`talks` or `talking` command-line tool wrap your command-line commands with talks hooks:

```bash
$ talking bundle install
```

After that `talks` will wrap execution of this command with voice messages. By default messages will be like 'command_name task started/ended'.
You can preconfigure messages in your `~/.talksrc` file or you can send options right in the talking command:

```bash
$ talking -v agnes -bm 'We gonna die!' -am 'Not sure if we can hear that' rm -rf ./
# the same
$ talking --voice agnes --before-message 'We...' --after-message 'Not...' rm -rf ./
```

### Using talks in your code

```bash
$ gem install talks
```

Then in your code you can require and use Talks functions:

```ruby
require 'talks'

Talks.say 'Hello bro!'

# There are 4 types of voice: say or info, warn, success, error
Talks.info 'This is info'
# Talks.warn 'Some text'
# Talks.success 'Some text'
# Talks.error 'Some text'
```

`Talks.say` can be customized with type of message and voice by adding options to this method parameters:

```ruby
Talks.say 'Hello like pipe', voice: 'pipe'
Talks.say 'Hello like error', type: :error # the same as using Talks.error
```

All voices which I've found in `say` manual:
```ruby
VOICES = %w(
  agnes albert alex bad bahh bells boing bruce bubbles cellos
  deranged fred good hysterical junior kathy pipe princess ralph
  trinoids vicki victoria whisper zarvox
)
```

### Using talks with espeak

You can configure your `talks` engine even to tell MacOS X to use [espeak](http://espeak.sourceforge.net):

`~/.talksrc`
```yml
engine: 'espeak'
```

Otherwise `talks` will set engine by default. It will be set to `say` on MacOS X and to `espeak` on all other OS-es if command `which espeak` returns non-empty string.

You can even configure your language in espeak (this gem still doesn't support different languages). Voices for espeak:

```ruby
Talks.voices[:espeak]
# =>
  [
    'en+m1', 'en+m2', 'en+m3', 'en+m4', 'en+m5', 'en+m6', 'en+m7',
    'en+f1', 'en+f2', 'en+f3', 'en+f4', 'en+f5', 'en+f6', 'en+f7'
  ]
```

## Who?

I did it myself.
